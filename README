This is the README file for the Mortgage Calculator

The calculator is rather simple.  Enter the information that is requested and the program will
calculate your monthly payment.

Guide for entering in information:

For amount borrowed, do not use commas or periods.
  
For the annual interest rate, enter as a percent (without the percent symbol).  For example, if
you are expecting to pay 6.5%, enter 6.5.

Everything else will be calculated correctly!
